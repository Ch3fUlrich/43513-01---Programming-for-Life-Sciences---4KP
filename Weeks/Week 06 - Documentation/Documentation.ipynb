    "In the field of bioinformatics, software is often badly documented. This is presumably due to time constraints and/or the belief that software is first and foremost written for oneself or the lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, even _if_ software is really only used by yourself, documentation is still valuable, because your _future self_ is also another person, so to say. You will surely have a hard time figuring out your code when you look at it in a few weeks, months, years time!\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, good scientific practices require proper documentation of code. Not doing so would be the equivalent of just publishing raw data, maybe with an unannotated set of protocols. So documenting and annotating your code is critically important for context, reusability, interpretability and, more generally, scientific provenance! Let's have a look at a number of ways how you can improve your codebase in those respects."
