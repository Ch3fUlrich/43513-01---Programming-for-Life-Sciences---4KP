    "\n",
    "A very important concept implemented in most, if not all, programming languages is the principle of *encapsulation*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is that code should be written in a modular manner, each functionality being implemented in a piece of code that communicates with the rest of the code via an interface. This has many advantages, such as \n",
    "\n",
    "* each piece of code can be written and tested *independently* of other code\n",
    "* variables values will not be inadvertently changed somewhere else in the program\n",
    "* the code can be easily shared and reused, as users only need to know the interface of the code\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, it becomes much easier to ensure that a particular functionality is implemented correctly, it can be optimized without affecting other parts of a program, and once the development of the code is complete, it does not have to be revisited when another part of the program is modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, encapsulated code can be conveniently reused without having to worry how it does what it does, just like a *black box*:\n",
    "```\n",
    "        ____________\n",
    "       | BLACK  BOX |\n",

    "Another very general purpose module that we should look at is `argparse`. It provides a wide range of functionalities associated with the parsing commandline arguments, enforcing the correct use of programs. The full documentation on the module can be found at https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html. Here we will go through a few important features of this module. The basic idea is to construct an object containing all the relevant information about the commandline arguments that we expect and use this object to parse the commandline, extracting the individual arguments. While we may have done this ourselves in other programming languages, parsing the commandline to extract arguments and ensure that they have the correct type, range etc. is really tedious and error-prone. Let's look at the most basic way of using the module:"

    "* Distribute all imports into three separate blocks, separated with one blank line: imports from (1) built-in, (2) third-party (i.e., from packages you have installed manually) and (3) local (i.e., from _this_ project) modules. Sort each block alphabetically by the package/module names (irrespective of whether you use `import` or `from ... import`).\n",

    "#### Installing packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Packages are also the container that is used most commonly to publish Python projects. Over the years, innumerable packages have been written for Python that one can *install* and use. The biggest resource for Python packages is the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/), more commonly referred to as PyPI. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python packages can be installed via the package manager Pip that should be automatically installed together with Python (you can verify that it is available with `pip --version`). When installing a package that is listed in PyPI, the syntax is very simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install package_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where `package_name` is the name of the package you would like to install.\n",
    "\n",
    "When installing a package, Pip fetches the code from a repository and stores it in an efficient way on your local file system so that you can use it in the future. The location where packages are stored is pre-configured and typically does not need to be modified. If you want to find out where a given package was installed, you can run `pip show package_name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful to know that Pip can also be used to install packages from sources other than PyPI, e.g., from Git repositories:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Install code from default branch\n",
    "pip install git+https://github.com/user/repo.git\n",
    "\n",
    "# Install code from specific branch/tag/commit\n",
    "pip install git+https://github.com/user/repo.git@branch/tag/commit\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, Pip can also be used to install a Python package from the current directory. For this, we need to be in the root directory of the project, which should contain instructions about package installation (a `pyproject.toml` file is the currently preferred option, a `setup.py` file was used before and still works currently). If available, you can execute the following command to install your local package:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it is useful to install a Python project that you are currently working on. In that case, it is best to install the package in an \"editable\" manner by providing the `-e` flag when installing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -e .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This would not copy any files to your interpreter directory (e.g. the `site-packages` directory)."

    "2. It is very useful (particularly for users of your software) to explicitly **version your code**. We strongly recommend you adhere to the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) specification for this purpose, a 3-part versioning system (a fourth part is optional) composed of major (for breaking changes to the software's interface), minor (for backwards-compatible changes to the software's interface) and patch (for changes that do not change the software's interface).\n",
