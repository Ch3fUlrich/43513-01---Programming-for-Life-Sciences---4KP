This Repository is mandatory for the course mentioned in the title. Weekly lectures are added to the repository as well as the progress in the project that is used for passing the lecture.

**The Project will be solved using Jupyter Notebook and Python 3.11**

# Gillespie Simulation Project
## Synopsis
This project implements a Gillespie simulation of a microRNA-transcription factor-target protein feed-forward loop (FFL) in gene regulation. This stochastic simulation algorithm is used to model the time evolution of well-mixed biochemical systems.
## Background
Biological processes are often stochastic in nature. This simulation focuses on a genetic circuit that can buffer stochastic fluctuations in gene expression. The circuit consists of:
- A transcriptional regulator (transcription factor, q)
- A post-transcriptional regulator (microRNA, s)
- A target protein-coding gene (p)
The transcription factor activates the target gene, while the microRNA induces degradation of the target mRNA, repressing its expression (incoherent feed-forward loop). More details can be found in the [Background Information](background.md).
## Reactions
The simulation includes the following reactions:
1. TF transcription and decay
2. TF translation and protein decay
3. miRNA production and decay
4. Target mRNA transcription and decay
5. Target protein translation and decay
6. miRNA-mediated mRNA degradation
## Gillespie Algorithm
The Gillespie algorithm is used to simulate the stochastic dynamics of the system. It involves:
1. Calculating reaction rates based on current molecule numbers
2. Determining the time to the next reaction
3. Selecting which reaction occurs
4. Updating molecular species and time

## Versioning 
This is a student project, where each of the students contributes via their own branch and then pushes a merge request to the main branch.
## Contributors
Students of the course "Programming for Life Sciences" at the Biozentrum Basel.
